# LLM-ScienceExam
The aim of the project is to use Large Language Model to answer difficult science questions. To approach this task we will be using the PACE frame-work that is an accronym for a 4 stage approach Plan, Analyze, Construct and Execute.
## Plan :
    1. Goal : To use an LLM Model and use it to answer science related questions.
    2. Approach : Fine tuning either the top few layers or adding customized layers on top of the built in layers and train them with the data at hand.
    3. Startegies : 
        1. Data : Data sets uploaded in the repository. Seperate training and testing data files.
        2. KPI's : Accuracy.
        3. Tools : Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and more.
        4. Details about the production environment:[Production Conda Environment:](config.yml)
        4. Deliverables for plan stage : Structured initial pathway to project completion via README file.
## Analyze :
    1. Data transformations as required.
    2. EDA to better understand the data.
    3. All possible insights uncovered
    4. Suggestions about the project.
    5. Deliverables : 
        1. Notebook File.
        2. Executive Summary of the procedure including insights and problems encountered.
## Construct :
    1. This stage includes the following processes:
        1. Deciding what insights to pursue.
        2. Deciding the architecture of the LLM.
        3. Training the model.
        4. Inital Testing.
        5. Optimization and Hypertuning to yield better results.
    2. Deliverables :
        1. Notebook file
        2. Executive Summary of the path taken and the results yielded.
## Execute :
    1. Organize the Project.
    2. Execute any remaining suggestions for project presentaion.
    3. Deliverables :
        1. Trained model.
        2. Executive summary.
        3. Best performance metrics logged.
        4. Deployment not required.
